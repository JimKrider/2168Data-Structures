2168 Data-Structures Class Programs
===================

##Hey You, if you are in 2168 Data-Structures read below!
If you are currently in Data Structures and need help, contact me. I am more than willing to help you, I have a lot of books that helped me do well in the class, and I have a solid understanding of BST and a lot of the algorithms that you will learn in the class. I also have a lot of code that I have not posted, but I can, of Binary Search Tree and other algo's examples that show up on the exams and quizes. I also have past exams, and all the extra credit problems.
